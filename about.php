                <h2>Animal Adoption</h2>
                <p>Animal adoption is the process whereby a person brings an animal, mostly cats and
dogs, to their own care. These animals that are either lost or abandoned are taken by
the animal control to be kept in animal shelters. Pets that are kept in the shelters for a
long time are euthanized to reduce the number of overpopulation of unwanted
animals.
 </p>
                <p>The inspiration of this project is a web-based adoption site for people to be more
aware of stray animals waiting to be adopted around us.</p>
